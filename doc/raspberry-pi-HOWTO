Head over to https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspbian/ and download the LITE version. As of writing this, it is 
RASPBIAN STRETCH LITE. Extract the file with .img extension only from the compressed archieve.
Download the microSD card burner from https://etcher.io
Insert your microSD card reader/writer and burn the .img file on your microSD card.
After a successful burn & eject , remove the microSD card from the writer and insert it into Raspberry Pi and hook it up with a 
HDMI Monitor or a TV. For video demonstration, just watch https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJDIgS8nres

Default login is "pi" and password is "raspberry"
Run raspi-config and enable ssh access on your Pi first. ( you have to use sudo there )
Read: http://www.instructables.com/id/Use-ssh-to-talk-with-your-Raspberry-Pi/
Find out the IP address of your Pi by logging into your home DSL/Fiber device. It will show as "pi".

From now on, just paste the following commands to your raspberry

sudo passwd (set up sudo access. its self explanatory)
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get upgrade -y
sudo apt-get install build-essential libssl-dev libdb++-dev libdb-dev libboost-all-dev libqrencode-dev libminiupnpc-dev nano git
sudo git clone https://github.com/signatumd/source.git
cd source/src/leveldb/
chmod +x build_detect_platform
make libleveldb.a libmemenv.a
cd .. .. ( its two times .. with a space )
make -f makefile.unix -j2 ( this will build the wallet / daemon for your Pi. Patience there ...)
strip signatumd
sudo mv signatumd /usr/bin
signatumd ( run it once and wait for it to give you a config missing error )
cd ( enter )
cd .signatumd ( enter )
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/signatumd/releases/master/signatum.conf ( enter )
cd ( enter )
signatumd ( enter )

^ this runs the wallet or the daemon. You can check the sync progress by issuing:

tail -f .signatumd/debug.log ( press Ctrl+C to cancel )

Get a wallet address

signatumd getnewaddress ( enter )

Copy that address and send 1 SIGT as a test. Wait for a block confirmation and it should show up after you do a :

signatumd getbalance ( enter )

Thats pretty much it. Ask me for tips on Discord or Telegram on how to stake SIGT on your PI.
